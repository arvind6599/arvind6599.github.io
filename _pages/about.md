Welcome to my Page! I am a 1st Year Master's student at EPFL pursuing an MSc in Data Science. I have prior research experience in statistical learning, optimization, classical and quantum machine learning algorithms. Prior to my master's degree I was a Software developer at Adobe working on feature development for an Enterprise Application Software. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

I am currentlty seeking ML Research Engineer and Quantitative Research internship roles for the summer of 2023. You can checkout my [Preprints here](https://arvind6599.github.io/publications/).
