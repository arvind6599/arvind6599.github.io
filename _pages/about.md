Welcome to my Page! I am an undergrad from IIT Madras with a BTech in Engineering Physics who is currently working as software developer in Adobe. My research work/interests features a smooth transition from quantum mechanics and quantum computing to classical ML and statistics research. I will be joining EPFL to pursue an MSc in Data Science this Fall

My current research experience is in the field of Statistical learning, Convex optimization, quantum machine learning and quantum cryptography. In the future i wish to explore fields such as Deep Learning, Recommender systems and pursue a career in the field of AI research post my Masters degree. You can checkout my [Preprints here](https://arvind6599.github.io/publications/).
