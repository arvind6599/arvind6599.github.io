Welcome to my Page! I am a second-year Master's student at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), specializing in Data Science. My research interests are Deep Reinforcement Learning, Portfolio optimization, Systematic stratgies, Convex and Non-Convex Optimization, and Time Series forecasting.

In January 2024 I finished my 6 month internship at [Garda Capital Partners](https://www.gardacp.com/) as a Quantitative Analyst. I got to work on many different projects, to name a few:
- State Of The Art Deep Reinforcement Learning Model which performs portfolio construction for a bag of strategies.
- Constructed a Risk Aversion Index and a rule-based trading strategy based on the index.
- Developed trend following strategies based on Emergent Market IRP Signals.
- Made monthly forecasts of the US Manufacturing PMI using the latest time series models.

Prior to embarking on my Master's journey, I worked as a Software Developer at Adobe in the Digital Experience business unit. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in `Engineering Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras`.

`I am currently looking for internship oppurtinies to work as a Quantitative Analyst or Quantitative Researcher for my Master's Thesis for a period of 6 Months starting August or September 2024 as part of my Master's degree at EPFL`. I aim to leveraging my academic background, practical experiences, and passion for data science to contribute meaningfully as an intern.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to sharing more about my journey and insights with you.
